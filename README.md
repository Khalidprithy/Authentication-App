## Documentation
Authentication App built with React and Tailwind for frontend and Nodejs ExpressJs MongoDB for backend. I did not store any sensible data on the MongoDB server. The whole Login and SignUp is handled by firebase so it's more secure. It also offers the flexibility to customize in future. I have used react-hook-form for the Login Sign Up form. All error and condition is also handled with react-hook-form.
